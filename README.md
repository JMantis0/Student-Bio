# Student-Bio

This is a classroom activity where we took a plain looking student bio page and were challenged to create a css file to make the site appear like the demo.

This Activity helped me learn:

how to link the HTML file to the CSS file

how to center an element within another using 'margin: auto'

how to select HTML id elements with # and class elements with . in css

that 'width: __%'  sets the width of an element to a percentage of the element containing it

how to add padding and margins to elements to adjust how they appear in the browser

how to make elements in-line by using 'float: left;'
